        <h2 style="text-align:center">My Coding Wishlist:</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center">These are just some imaginative dev projects that I'd want to possibly make in the near future.<br>
          Of course I'm quite distant from the skill level required to make any of these, so they currently<br>
          serve the purpose of maintaining my motivation in continuing to learn more about<br> Software Development.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center">1. An extremely lightweight<br> first person shooter</h2>

        <p style="text-align:center">The idea sounds simplistic on paper, but I want to put emphasis on the word "lightweight", because I want the game to<br> both show little to no hiccups on at the very least, devices with 1 to 2 gigs of ram, while still being absurdly fun to play.<br> It would feature smooth and fast-paced gameplay and  offer its players a good number of features to mess around with.<br> The 2 essential goals for this game are simply being as lightweight as possible without sacrificing parts of the gameplay<br> experience. A decent example of this would be the FPS game, <a style="color:inherit;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw63IVgYLDc">Ultrakill</a>, which impressed me with how efficient it ran on<br> my low-spec laptop. That kind of optimized performance is what I want for any game. The game I'll make will feature a<br> futuristic theme and physics different from that of Ultrakill with a similarly exhilarating gameplay experience. The game<br> will have the usual FPS features such as a matchmaking system, a ranking system, and a variety of weapon choices. As<br> performance optimizing techniques and device optimization features advance, making a highly performance-efficient<br> game will only get easier, but only time will tell.
        <h2 style="text-align:center">2. An Android launcher creator/editor</h2>

        <p style="text-align:center">Customization is one of the biggest selling points of Android phones, so much so that even <a style="color:inherit;" href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-16/">Apple</a> has started bringing it<br> to their operating system. However, it's not just Android itself that brings the magic, but installable launchers that further<br> enhance custmization options. While the options in the Google Play Store are abundant, less than half are actually good,<br> leaving customization heads like us with a craving for more. To that I bring a universal solution, what if we had a way to<br> just make our own launcher? My approach to this would be to make a launcher so customizable that you could end up<br> with a final product completely different from the original, making it completely unique to you. Not only would this thing<br> eliminate the issue of only having a few actually good launchers available, but it would allow the widest of customization<br> options, giving the user the big say in what his/her phone UI should look like.
