        <p>I'm a beginner coder on a learning journey, trying to find my path<br> to possibly becoming a skilled software developer. This is based on my desire<br> to build fun interactive software and applications which can be anything like<br> websites, games, and other application types.</p>

        <p style="float:right">This is my very first attempt at creating a project solely based on my current abilities as a coder. Make no mistake, being a web<br> developer isn't the farthest I wish to go, for as mentioned above, I want to make fun interactive software, but that will<br> unfortunately have to wait, as my knowledge and abilities have more than a long way to go. All of this begins with my<br> appreciation for the digital world, what it means to imaginative people like me, and how I wanna make creative and wild stuff<br> for entertainment purposes. In case you are wondering, the girl to the left of your screen is quite eye catching, which is<br> intentional as it clearly stole your attention as you are probably still reading this (and I'm also a weeb).</p>

        <p>Now that I have your attention, here are some fun facts about this site's creator(aka me):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I'm male</li>
          <li>My favorite colors are teal, maroon, purple, silver, black, blue, and neon colors</li>
          <li>I was 5 or 6 when I first learned how to type</li>
          <li>Plazma Burst 2 is the game I have the most amount of play-time hours on</li>
          <li>I love customizing my desktop</li>
          <li>I'm a Windows-Android guy</li>
          <li>I started learning how to code on codecademy</li>
          <li>I love EDM and Alternative Rock</li>
          <li>I touch grass</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aside from all of that, that's all you need to know about me so far.<br> My objective goal for this site is to do as much to it as possible and making fixes and adjustments while learning from those things.</p><p style="text-align:center">Without further ado, sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.</p>
